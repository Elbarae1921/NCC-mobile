# NCC-mobile
a hybrid mobile app version of [NCC](https://github.com/Elbarae1921/NCC) made using [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/).

## Installation

To run this project locally you can either install the React Native CLI and an android/ios emulator, or you can use the Expo wrapper. ([read more here](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)).
Then after configuring your environment (make sure it's a typescript workflow) and creating a project, copy over the files to your project directory.

## Usage

### Expo CLI :
### ```expo start```
Then open the Expo client in your phone (Android) or the camera app (iOS) and scan the QR Code to be able to run the app.

### React Native CLI :
### ```react-native run-adnroid```
You should then see the app running in your Android emulator. (You can also run it directly from Android Studio).
